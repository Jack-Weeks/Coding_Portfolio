    "## Review of using Python to Model the Projectile Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall I feel VPython is more than capable of modelling the physics that occurs in a collision between two, or more objects. However is would be skeptical to trust the numerical outcomes, particularly for our attempt as we used a number of assumptions to simplify the process such as assuming 100% of the momementum is transferred into the object, which in reality rarely occurs, and the object intuitively should bounce off somewhat. Our chosen timestep can incur errors particularly at high velocities - although this can be fixed by adjusting the timestep, it is favourable to have an infintesimally small timestep in order to correctly identify the point of collision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the \"game\" we used an object with much larger radius than that of the object used in our calculations, which reduces clarity for the player and as a result of this we assume that the masses are entirely uniform, and that all the mass of both objects is concentrated in their centres. A way of improving this is by calculating their moment of inertia. Building on this idea it could be possible to work out the angular velocity $\\alpha = \\frac{d^2 \\theta }{dt^2}$ and hence have the block rotate proportional to the force applied, rather than an arbitraty rotation through 90 Degrees, this is related to the total torque $\\tau_{applied} - \\tau_{restoring}$ by $\\tau = I \\alpha $ where $I$ is the moment of inertia\n",
    "\n",
    "To impliment a more accurate model in Python I believe that we should ask the user if they would like air resistance, therefore introducing extra decelleration in both directions, and reducing the acceleration due to gravity. This would aid to make the games more realistic, however we would have to assume that the resistive force was constant such that the equations of motion did not break.Furthermore if we could compute the angle of interaction between the object and the projectile at the point of collision we could more accurately calculate the components of momentum, and hence the force exerted on the block which can then be used to calculate acceleration as outlined in the second paragraph. Furthermore developing on the idea that it is rare for all the momentum to be transferred into the block, the block could be made of different materials, each with it's own coefficient of restitution, and hence would transfer variable amounts of force to the block, this can be implimented fairly easily as was done in session 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an added extra, it would be possible to \"replay\" the collision with a much lower rate, and perhaps timestep allowing for a zoomed in scene to be created, allowing for a more precise model of the collision and the subsequent energy transfers. This can be done by adding another looping structure with the same initial conditions as the ones input by the user.\n",
